Health problems can not only occur physically, but can also attack a person mentally. Data from the 2018 Basic Health Research (Riskesdas), shows that more than 19 million people aged more than 15 years have mental emotional disorders, and more than 12 million people aged more than 15 years have depression. Unaddressed mental disorders can cause a person to get sick more easily and reduce their quality of life. The Indonesian Psychiatric Association (PDSKJI) said that mental disorders in Indonesia increased from around 70% in 2020 to 80% in 2022. 

People in Indonesia, especially teenagers when they are under pressure, have no place to tell stories, how to deal with problems and solutions to problems faced? lack of education on mental health problems, how to manage a healthy lifestyle both in terms of time and diet? factors that make it difficult for people to adapt to new environments, how do these factors affect their mental health?

Therefore, to overcome these problems we chose to provide education related to mental health, namely tips on overcoming stress, recognition and prevention of mental health disorders so as to lead the community to do positive things. 

Yournalling is a mental health and well-being journal that can help people to improve their life based on their daily mood and states. We strive to help everyone to have a sense of comfort when venting, realising discomfort, and keeping the body and mind in a healthy condition.
